/*What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
It is important to know the relative path and filename of the CSS file and the appropriate code to insert into the <head> portion of your HTML:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=filename.css>
What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
We used the float, margin, and path properties on the appropriate elements to position. It was difficult to get the site to look as we wanted it and it required a lot of trial and error.
What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
We used the color, font-weight, and font-size properties in order to modify the element style.
Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
We modified the HTML to include classes. We used those rather than ids because we needed to group like elements together, rather than single out one iteration of a specific element type.
When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
Our site had cleaner code than the actual code base because we used a CSS stylesheet instead of attempting to style each element inline.*/
