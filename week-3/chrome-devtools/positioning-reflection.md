What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult? Static is the default positioning; relative refers to a position in relation to where the element would "normally" be; absolute allows you to set an element's position to anywhere on the page, unaffected by other elements; fixed position elements are positioned relative to the browser itself, and never move when the page is scrolled. Fixed position is the easiest to use out of all of these; absolute position in the hardest.
