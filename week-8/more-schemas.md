## What is a one-to-one database? ##  
A one-to-one database is a database that is used when one thing in one data table has a singular relationship to another thing in another data table (that is, they are a pair).  
## When would you use a one-to-one database? ##  
You would use a one-to-one database in instances where a group of fields in one table can all optionally be NULL. For example, this schema models a management company's database of available apartments for rent. The apartments_for_rent table has fields for monthly rent, address, city, bedrooms, and bathrooms. It also has a field for complex id, because some apartments may be part of an apartment complex, and some are not (like, for example, they are in a duplex or a singular apartment building in a city). Each apartment cannot be in more than one apartment complex, so the relationship is one-to-one.

## What is a many-to-many database? ##  
A many-to-many database is a database that is used when multiple rows from one table can correspond to multiple rows in another table.  
## When would you use a many-to-many database? ##  
You would use a many-to-many database where many rows in one table may correspond to many rows in another table. In order to model the relationship, you need to create a join table (or cross-reference table) containing the foreign keys (id's) from the two tables with a many-to-many relationship. One example of a many-to-many relationship involves this set of grocery lists. In the grocery_lists table, I have a list of all of the different grocery stores that I might visit (Whole Foods, Cub Foods, Trader Joe's, Lunds, and Costco) and in the items table, I have a list of all the items that I might want to buy. Sometimes I might buy identical items at more than one grocery store, and I will also be buying more than one item from the items list at each grocery store, so there is a many-to-many relationship. I use the join table to model this relationship.

## What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense? ##  
The most confusing thing about database schemas to me, besides the somewhat convoluted way that Schema Designer works, is being able to categorize relationships as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. What makes sense to me is the way that real-life datasets can be modeled with database schemas; creating individual tables is relatively easy to me. It is joining/relating those tables that is still confusing.
