What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Delivery, Maintenance
What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My site's primary goal/purpose will be to serve as my professional website where employers will be able to find out about me and the work I have done as a programmer.
What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience will be prospective employers, and their interests will be in finding out about my work history, background, and past projects. My site will display this information in a simple and easy-to-use format.
What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
I would like the primary "action" that the user takes to be viewing my home page, navigating to my project portfolio, and then contacting me using the social media links provided.
What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
The main things that someone should know about design and user experience are that UX is a very important part of Web design. A website that strives to give its users a good UX will give those users value, be easy to use, be pleasant to use, and make users want to return to that site. Also, design should focus not just on the needs of the client, but on the needs of the user as well.
What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
User experience design refers to how a person feels when interacting with a system. UX design is valuable because it creates for better relationships between users (who have better feelings when they use a site) and the website and its products, and can be the most valuable tool in creating repeat visitors.
Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I found the readings on UX design to be a bit repetitive, especially as they included links to at least twenty different UX blogs and information sites that I don't see where I have a lot of use for at this early stage in the design of my website.
