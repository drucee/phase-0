<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site? I thought this was an interesting exercise, especially working with a live site, albeit a very simple one.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements? I found the HTML reference to be a useful source and it helped me to remember some of the specifics of tags and syntax that I had forgotten.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML) We were able to remember not to add formatting to the HTML; however, some of the specifics of the best practices, like indentation standards, can be difficult to remember.
- What seems good and bad about HTML? The positives of HTML are that it is a powerful tool that can be very expressive as far as formatting is concerned, especially when the near-limitless possibilities of CSS are concerned. The layout and positioning of HTML, however, can be difficult to keep track of and having to repeat tags frequently can be cumbersome and make the process of writing HTML slow.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML? My biggest trick is to continually check the HTML reference when I forget tags, and also to practice writing HTML over and over again because there is a lot of arcane syntax to remember and HTML is not particularly forgiving of syntax deviations.
