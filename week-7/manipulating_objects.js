 // Manipulating JavaScript Objects

// I worked on this challenge: [by myself, with: ]

// There is a section below where you will write your code.

// DO NOT ALTER THIS OBJECT BY ADDING ANYTHING WITHIN THE CURLY BRACES!
var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown"
}
// __________________________________________
// Write your code below.


var adam = {};
adam.name = "Adam";
terah.spouse = adam;
terah.weight = 125;
delete terah.eyeColor;
adam.spouse = terah;
terah.children = {};
terah.children.carson = {name: "Carson"};
terah.children.carter = {name: "Carter"};
terah.children.colton = {name: "Colton"};
adam.children = terah.children;







// __________________________________________
// Reflection: Use the reflection guidelines
//What tests did you have trouble passing? What did you do to make it pass? Why did that work?
// I had the most trouble with tests 7 through 13 creating the "children" subproperties.
// Eventually I figured out that my syntax was wrong and that I would need to figure out how to create objects
// inside of other objects. Once I was able to do that I was able to get a handle
// on passing those tests.
//How difficult was it to add and delete properties outside of the object itself?
// Adding and deleting properties was not difficult once I remembered that JavaScript syntax functions differently from Ruby syntax.
//What did you learn about manipulating objects in this challenge?
// I learned that objects can be manipulated outside of the object itsef, and that objects can be
// nested in JS and nested objects can be created just like single-layer objects (is there a better word for this?)
//
